# KeyLoggerPlus--EmailAndPassword
This project is a Windows keylogger script written in Python that logs keystrokes, detects sensitive information like email addresses and potential passwords, and stores them in a text file. The script can be converted to an executable and set to auto-start on boot for background logging. Itâ€™s for educational purposes only.
## Features

- Logs keystrokes to a file located at:
  - `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Keylogs.txt`
- Automatically differentiates:
  - **Email addresses**
  - **Potential passwords**
- Can be converted into an `.exe` file for easier deployment.
- Option to auto-start on system boot.

## Prerequisites

1. Install **Python 3.x** on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput pygetwindow

   ```
3. Install **PyInstaller** to convert the script into an `.exe` file (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

## Steps to Run

### 1. Running the Script
1. Clone the repository or download the `keylogger.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or Command Prompt in the directory where `keylogger.py` is located.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

The logs will be saved to the `Keylogs.txt` file in the `Documents` folder of the current user.

### 2. Converting to an Executable (Optional)
To run the keylogger without Python installed, convert it into an `.exe` file:

1. Open a terminal or Command Prompt in the folder containing `keylogger.py`.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole keylogger.py
   ```
3. After the build process completes, locate the executable in the `dist/` folder.
4. Move the `keylogger.exe` file to your project directory or another location.

### 3. Setting the EXE to Auto-Run on Boot
To make the keylogger start automatically when Windows boots:

#### Option 1: Add to the Startup Folder
1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and hit **Enter**.
2. Copy the `keylogger.exe` file into this folder.
3. The keylogger will now auto-run on boot.

#### Option 2: Modify the Windows Registry
1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press **Enter**.
2. Navigate to the registry path:
   ```
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   ```
3. Right-click in the right-hand pane and select **New > String Value**.
4. Name the value something like `Keylogger`.
5. Double-click the new entry and set its value to the full path of `keylogger.exe`, for example:
   ```
   C:\Path\To\keylogger.exe
   ```
6. Close the Registry Editor.

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **EXE does not auto-start on boot**:
   - Ensure the path in the Windows Registry is correct and points to `keylogger.exe`.
   - Check if the `.exe` file has sufficient permissions to run.
   - Verify that antivirus software has not blocked or deleted the executable.

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Make sure to run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
