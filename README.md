# KeyLoggerPlus--EmailAndPassword
This project is a Windows keylogger script written in Python that logs keystrokes, detects sensitive information like email addresses and potential passwords, and stores them in a text file. The script can be converted to an executable and set to auto-start on boot for background logging. Itâ€™s for educational purposes only.
